# Python Code Reference  

## Overview  
This repository, **Python Code Reference**, contains Python scripts that have been evaluated and graded by an automated **code grader**, where I achieved a **100% score**. The high score reflects adherence to best practices in Python programming, including correctness, efficiency, and code structure.  

## Purpose  
I use these scripts as a **reference** when writing Python code. While Python is well known for its **indentation-based syntax**, code graders evaluate a much broader set of criteria, including:  

- **Code structure** – Proper organization of functions, classes, and modules.  
- **Function design** – Clear input parameters, return values, and modularity.  
- **Variable naming** – Meaningful, readable, and PEP-8-compliant names.  
- **Class definitions** – Correct use of object-oriented programming principles.  
- **Efficiency** – Optimized logic, loop structures, and algorithm design.  
- **Readability** – Proper formatting, docstrings, and comments.
